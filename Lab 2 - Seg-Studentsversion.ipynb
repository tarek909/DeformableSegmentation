    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Image segmentation plays a fundamental role in various computer vision and medical imaging applications. It involves partitioning an image into meaningful regions, typically based on features such as intensity, color, or texture. The ultimate goal is to simplify the representation of an image into segments that are easier to analyze and interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will explore and compare three popular segmentation techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic/Semi-Automatic Region Growing**  \n",
    "   Region growing methods work by grouping pixels into larger regions based on predefined similarity criteria (e.g., intensity values).  \n",
    "   - In **Automatic** region growing, initial seeds are selected automatically based on image statistics, and the regions expand until a stopping criterion is met.  \n",
    "   - In **Semi-Automatic** region growing, seeds are chosen or labeled by a user (or a ground-truth label), and the region expands around these seeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Active Contours **  \n",
    "   Active contour models, are curves that move within the image to find object boundaries. They are “deformable” in that they adapt their shape according to internal forces (tension and rigidity) and external forces (image gradients). These models are particularly useful for refining boundaries and can capture complex shapes under varying image conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Graph Cut**  \n",
    "   Graph-based segmentation methods, such as Graph Cut, represent the image as a graph where each pixel (or set of pixels) corresponds to a node. Edges between nodes represent the similarity or “cost” of assigning those nodes to the same region. A cut in the graph effectively partitions the image into distinct segments. This approach can handle global constraints and often provides robust segmentations, especially when combined with prior knowledge or user input (e.g., scribbles indicating foreground/background).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method leverages different mathematical formulations and optimization techniques to achieve segmentation. By comparing these methods, we gain insights into their strengths, limitations, and possible applications. In the following sections, you will find the **Python code** and detailed instructions to experiment with and analyze the three segmentation techniques.\n",

    "# Region Growing\n",
    "\n",
    "Region growing is one of the simplest and most intuitive methods for image segmentation. It starts by selecting one or more “seed” pixels in the image. These seeds can be chosen automatically based on certain statistical properties (unsupervised) or provided by the user (supervised). The algorithm then iteratively examines neighboring pixels and determines whether they belong to the same region based on a similarity criterion (e.g., intensity, color, or texture).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a neighboring pixel satisfies the similarity criterion, it is merged into the current region; if not, it remains unsegmented or forms part of a different region. This process continues until no more pixels can be added to any region. The end result is a collection of regions representing different segments of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Region growing provides a valuable introduction to segmentation concepts, offering a straightforward approach that underscores the importance of proper seed selection and defining meaningful similarity metrics.  \n"

    "## Objective:\n",
    "In this assignment, you will implement parts of a region-growing segmentation algorithm. The algorithm segments an image into regions based on pixel intensity similarity. The implementation utilizes a stack-based approach to explore neighboring pixels and grow regions iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Components:\n",
    "1. **Stack Class**: A utility class that mimics a stack data structure for managing pixel coordinates during the region-growing process.\n",
    "   - Methods include `push`, `pop`, `size`, `isEmpty`, and `clear`.\n",
    "   - You will complete the implementation of these methods where indicated with `#TODO`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **RegionGrow Class**: The main class implementing the region-growing segmentation algorithm.\n",
    "   - **Initialization (`__init__`)**: Loads the image and sets up the required variables.\n",
    "   - **Neighbor Finding (`getNeighbour`)**: Finds valid neighbors of a pixel within image boundaries.\n",
    "   - **Seed Creation (`create_seeds`)**: Generates initial seed points to begin the segmentation process.\n",
    "   - **Region Growing (`ApplyRegionGrow`)**: The main algorithm that grows regions iteratively.\n",
    "   - **Breadth-First Search (`BFS`)**: Explores neighboring pixels and determines if they belong to the current region based on a similarity threshold.\n",
    "   - **Region Reset (`reset_region`)**: Resets small regions that do not meet size requirements.\n",
    "   - **Boundary Check (`boundaries`)**: Checks if a pixel coordinate is within image boundaries.\n",
    "   - **Pixel Distance (`distance`)**: Calculates the intensity difference between pixels.\n",
    "   - You will implement key logic for pixel validation, stopping conditions, and neighbor exploration in the marked `#TODO` sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualization**: The segmented image is visualized using matplotlib to display the results of the region-growing process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You Need to Do:\n",
    "- Implement the missing logic in the `Stack` class.\n",
    "- Complete the `boundaries`, `distance`, and `PassedAll` methods in the `RegionGrow` class.\n",
    "- Add stopping conditions and pixel exploration logic in the `BFS` method.\n",

    "# Introduction to Active Contours\n",
    "\n",
    "Active Contour Models,  are an influential approach to image segmentation that dynamically deforms a curve (or “contour”) to capture object boundaries. The fundamental idea is to initialize a curve near the region of interest and iteratively adjust its shape according to both **internal forces** (which smooth or regularize the contour) and **external forces** (derived from image features like edges or gradient magnitudes).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Parametric Representation**  \n",
    "   A contour is typically represented parametrically, \\( \\mathbf{v}(s) = [x(s), y(s)] \\), where \\( s \\in [0,1] \\). The shape and position of the contour are adjusted at each iteration to minimize an **energy function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Energy Function**  \n",
    "   The energy function comprises:  \n",
    "   - **Internal Energy**: Enforces smoothness and continuity of the curve (e.g., penalizing large changes in curvature).  \n",
    "   - **External Energy**: Drives the contour toward image features such as edges or salient boundaries. A common choice is the image gradient, encouraging the contour to align with strong edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialization and Evolution**  \n",
    "   - **Initialization**: The contour is placed roughly near the boundary of the object of interest.  \n",
    "   - **Evolution**: By iteratively updating the contour based on the total energy gradient, the curve “snaps” to the most prominent edges in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Active Contours provide a powerful framework for object boundary detection in images, highlighting the importance of combining image-derived forces with a regularizing contour model to achieve an accurate, smooth segmentation.\n"

    "# Introduction to Graph Cut Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph Cut is a powerful, globally oriented method for image segmentation. The core idea is to model the image as a graph where each pixel (or group of pixels known as “superpixels”) is represented by a node. Edges between nodes encode the cost or penalty of assigning those nodes to different segments, often based on pixel intensity differences or other similarity measures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Graph Representation**  \n",
    "   - **Nodes**: Each node represents a pixel (or superpixel).  \n",
    "   - **Edges**: Connecting edges define a cost of separating those nodes into different segments (e.g., high if pixels are very similar, low if pixels differ significantly).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Energy Minimization**  \n",
    "   We define an energy function over possible segmentations, which incorporates:  \n",
    "   - **Data Fidelity (Unary Terms)**: How well each pixel fits the label (foreground or background).  \n",
    "   - **Smoothness (Pairwise Terms)**: Encourages pixels with similar appearance to share the same label.  \n",
